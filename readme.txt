== Description ==

The very easy and simple <!-- more --> replacer. No more need to put the <!--more--> tag in your posts on the main blog page. You can easily change the text of the 'more' link.  
You can vary the abbreviation by the number of characters. 
You can set the length of posts that should be abbreviated, if a post is shorter, then there will be no 'more' link.
It is a blunt abbreviation, what means that words can be broken off. (What gives an extra teasing dimension.)
Images and links are removed and therefor do not count by the abbreviation. 
Other html-tags are kept intact.
By using this plug-in, all your abbreviated posts on your blog homepage are more or less the same length.
